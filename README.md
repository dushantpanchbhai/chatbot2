Add your project description here. Your project description should cover how your website/app works. That way you can convey what your project is without the need for anyone to view the code. A more detailed readme in your project repository is encouraged, which can include build and use instructions etc.

* Use bullet points for any feature descriptions you may want to add

```bash
    Add appropriate code snippets here (4 spaces indent)
```

Don't forget to replace the link here with **_your own Github repository_** link.

Along with this, add the link of the drive folder that contains the app APK/Screenshots/Screen Recordings. If you have hosted your project on the web, add that link as well.

* GitHub repo link: [Link to repository](https://github.com/your-repo-link)
* Drive link: [Drive link here](https://drive.google.com/)
* Website link: [Website link here](www.google.com)
